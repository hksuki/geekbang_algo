# 每周小结

## 动态规划

remember(memorization) and reuse solutions to sub-problems that help solve the problem.

so dp almost equals to **recursion plus memorization**。

time = #subproblems * time per sub-problem

according to things above, to solve dp problem, you should make clear what its sub-problem is.

### bottom-up view of DP

- exactly same computation
- what we are doing is a topological sort of the sub-problem dependency DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)
- can often save space
